Grade Calculator

This program takes the user input;
for the Subject that is being graded, 
the score the user got out of the total score;
and calculates the grade and shows it as a percentage when a button is hit ;
there is also a checkbox for if you want the total to be rounded up;
(ex. 87.3% --> 87%, 78.8% --> 79%)

there is a separate button that saves the data and results to a database;
in this  database, it stores the subject,
score achieved with the most points possible,
and the result- being the grade calculated;
it will also keep a T/F record of if the grade was rounded or not;

a messagebox shows up when you hit the "calculate" button without filling in all the textboxes;
to make sure all data is filled in the database 

however, there is no exception if the user inputs the wrong datatype in a textbox where something specific like a double/int is needed;
which then leads the program to crash;
so just use the program as intended and all is well with life :)

also in order for the intended data to save in the db;
you need to hit the calculate button, then save;
or else either the last thing you put in there will save or nothing will
