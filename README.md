grade calculator

This program takes the user input
for the Subject that is being graded, 
the score the user got out of the total score
and calculates the grade and shows it as a percentage when a button is hit 
there is also a checkbox for if you want the total to be rounded up
(ex. 87.3% --> 87%, 78.8% --> 79%)

there is a separate button that saves the data and results to a database 
in this  database, it stores the subject,
score achieved with the most points possible,
and the result- being the grade calculated 
it will also keep a T/F record of if the grade was rounded or not 

a messagebox shows up when you hit the "calculate" button without filling in all the textboxes
to make sure all data is filled in the database 

however, there is no exception if the user inputs the wrong datatype in a textbox where something specific like a double/int is needed
which then leads the program to crash
so just use the program as intended and all is well with life :)
